# Stock-Movement-Predection-using-NLP
Have quiet interest in NLP, So I wish to participate in project. Its a Team project
We used Machine learning techniques to evaluate past data pertaining to the stock market and world affairs of the corresponding time period, in order to make predictions in stock trends. We built a model that will be able to buy and sell stock based on profitable prediction, without any human interactions. The model uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to make smart “decisions” based on current affairs, article, etc. With NLP and the basic rule of probability, our goal is to increases the accuracy of the stock predictions.
